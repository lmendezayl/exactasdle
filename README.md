## About the project

**exactasdle** is a guessing game inspired by [Loldle](https://loldle.net), but focused on subjects from the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (FCEyN) at Universidad de Buenos Aires.

## Features
 Players must guess the daily subject based on attributes described below.
  - **Subject (Materia)**
  - **Department (Departamento)**: DM, DF, DC, DG, DBBE, DCAO, DEGE, DFBMC, DI, DQB, DQIAQF,  DQO
  - **Program (Carrera)**.
  - **Modality (Modalidad)**: obligatory, optional, or both
  - **Period (Periodo)**: annual, bimestrial, or quarterly-based.
  - **Level (Nivel)**: undergraduate, master's, and/or doctoral.
  - **Class Type (Clases)**: theory, practical, and/or lab lectures

Each day, the game resets and selects new attributes to challenge players with a new set of courses to guess.

## Tech Stack
