# exactasdle

**exactasdle** is a guessing game inspired by *Loldle*, but focused on university subjects in the Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales (University of Buenos Aires). Players must guess the subject by its attributes such as department, program, and modality.

## Features

- Guess subjects based on several attributes:  
  - **Subject (Materia)**: The name of the subject.
  - **Department (Departamento)**: The departments that offer the course.
  - **Program (Carrera)**: The degree programs the course is part of.
  - **Modality (Modalidad)**: Whether the course is mandatory, optional, or both.
  - **Period (Periodo)**: If the course is annual, bimestrial, or semester-based.
  - **Level (Nivel)**: The academic level, such as undergraduate, master's, and/or doctoral.
  - **Class Type (Tipo de clases)**: Whether the course has lectures, practical sessions, and/or labs.

Each day, the game resets and selects new attributes to challenge players with a new set of courses to guess.
